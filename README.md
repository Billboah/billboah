# 👋 Hi, I'm William Yeboah

🚀 **AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) | Cost-Efficient Cloud Architecture Specialist | Systems Thinker**

I design and architect **secure, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud systems** on AWS. My focus goes beyond infrastructure deployment — I specialize in creating architectures that are **strategically optimized for performance, reliability, and long-term cost efficiency**.

With a strong foundation in software engineering and a background in medical laboratory science, I bring **analytical precision, structured problem-solving, and systems thinking** into cloud architecture.

After completing the **ALX AWS Cloud Computing (Cloud Architect Track),** I am now focused on applying my skills in real-world environments and actively seeking opportunities as an **AWS Solutions Architect (Associate)**.

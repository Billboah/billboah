# 👋 Hi, I'm William Yeboah

🚀 **AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) | Cloud Cost Optimization Enthusiast | Systems Thinker**

I design and architect **secure, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud systems** on AWS. My focus is not just building infrastructure — but ensuring it is **optimized for performance, reliability, and long-term cost efficiency**.

With a strong foundation in backend engineering and a background in medical laboratory science, I bring **analytical precision, problem-solving, and systems thinking** into cloud architecture.

Currently completing the **ALX AWS Cloud Computing (Cloud Architect Track)** and **Backend Web Professional Developer** programs.
